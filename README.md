Metrics Definition:

Holdings
===
The number of assets you currently possess. For example, if I buy 5 BTC holdings would be 5

Total Cash
===
The total amount you earned by selling your assets. For example, if I bought 5 BTC and then sold 3 BTC at a price of £4
then the cash is £12. If I then re-invest the £12 then I still have £12 total cash although I don' pocess that amount any more.
Essentially,

`Total Cash = Sum of sells`

Total Amount Invested
===
The total amount that has been used to buy assets.

`Total Amount Invested = Sum of buys`

Exposure
===
`Total Amount Invested - Total Cash`

Current Value (Portfolio Value)
===
Total value of the given asset. For example, if I have 5 BTC and the current price is £10 then the current value of BTC in my pocession is equal to £50

`Current Value = Holdings * Current Price`

Safe Sell Price
===
The price which if we sell all the holding will be equal to our exposure. Essentially, it indicates the price at which our gains and losses will equal to 0;

Capital Growth
===
`Capital Growth = currentValue - exposure`
